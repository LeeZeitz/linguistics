                Before starting the experiment, we advise that you put the experiment in full screen mode and close all other programs that may be running on your device. We also suggest that you use headphones to listen to the experiment.

                You will listen to a series of two second audio clips of various speakers. You will first hear a tone followed by 200ms of silence and then the audio clip. Each audio clip will be played one at a time. After listening to each audio clip, you will be presented with eight questions about the speakerâ€™s personal attributes. Use the slider to answer all eight questions. Please respond as quickly as possible based on your initial reaction. You will not be able to replay the audio, so it is necessary you listen the entire time. 
                <br />
                <br />
                You must respond to each slider in order to continue. Once you have finished answering all eight questions press <b>proceed</b> and the next audio clip will play. At the end of the experiment you will be asked to answer a short demographic survey. Please complete the survey and then hit the submit button. <b>You must hit the submit button at the end of the experiment for your responses to be recorded.</b> If you wish to stop participating in the experiment hit the <b>Exit Experiment</b> button and your responses will not be saved.

                You will first hear two test stimuli that will help ensure the experiment is running correctly on your device. Once you have listened to the two test stimuli the experiment will begin.
